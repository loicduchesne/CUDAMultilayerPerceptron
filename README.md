# CUDA Implementation of a Multilayer Perceptron

This is an implementation of a Multilayer Perceptron from scratch, using GPU-acceleration from the CUPY package. This was inspired by the knowledge acquired in the context of COMP 551 (Applied Machine Learning) at McGill University, as well as being impatient with longer compute time.

The project is still in progress, as there are a few implementations missing.

### Requirements:
- Python 3.11
- Cupy
- Numpy
- CUDA-enabled Graphics Card
- CUDA Toolkit 12.1 (strict) (https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-1-0-download-archive)
- Microsoft Visual Studio (MSVC 14.37)(IDE or Toolkit) (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
- NVIDIA cuDNN (https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn)
